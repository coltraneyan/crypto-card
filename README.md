# Portal Wallet

Portal Wallet generates a WYSIWYG credit card displaying the address and a scannable QR code attached to a public wallet key provided. The card will support public addresses such as "0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268", as well as ENS domains such as "coltrane.eth".

# Technologies

The project was built using Javascript and React. Styling was handled via the CUBE CSS methodology. You will notice that in both the JSX and CSS, classes are ordered according to a -> Component | Utility | Block | Exception hierarchy.
